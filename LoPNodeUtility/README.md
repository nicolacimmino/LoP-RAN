LoP-RAN Node Utility
=======

This is a companion utility for LoP-RAN nodes. It's a windows desktop application that allows to easily setup the node configuration as well as to interact with its diagnostic interface for network problems troubleshooting.

The application scans continuosly the available ports and whenever a new node is detected it will create a new window to interact with it. The screenshot below shows the main tab from which various parameters such as the NID, msgp2p UID and the cron schedule can be edited:
